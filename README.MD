MyMuse
======

Beginning with a blank MVC project, I added this-and-that as I learned stuff watching Microsoft Virtual Academy courses and through my own 
curousity (i.e. how ID3 tags worked). Initially the project was titled "The Kitchen Sink", as it has a little bit of everything, then 
"MyMuse" as a music theme developed.

Techniques included so far are:
- Reflection & ID3 tags,
- XML (De)Serialization,
- Async files upload (WCF),
- Basic MVC with sorting & filter,
- EF 6, pagination,
- SignlarR Progress bar
- Identity

On TODO list are:

- Socket UL/DL
- Angular JS UL/DL monitoring
- Dynamically update view as EF loads
- Googledrive/Onedrive
- Win8 & Xamarin android client
- Custom pagination
- Notifications
- Printing, Prettifying
